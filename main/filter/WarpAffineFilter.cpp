 * @param dsize: Size of the destination image.
 * @param flags: Combination of interpolation methods and the optional flag WARP_INVERSE_MAP that means that M is the inverse transformation.
 * @param borderMode: Pixel extrapolation method. When borderMode=BORDER_TRANSPARENT , it means that the pixels in the destination image corresponding to the “outliers” in the source image are not modified by the function.
 * @param borderValue: Value used in case of a constant border. By default, it is 0.

 * filter automatically without having to write any further code for runtime behavior. In order for the filter to work with the
 * default values, we have to map the pointers to those default values, which happen to be private. We could of course make those
 * values also public, but then again, we only want to allow changes the way they are supposed to be changed to avoid confusion
 * and mistakes, just as we would do in case of only exporting the values via getter and setter methods.
